**TangoH: Amplifying Student Voices to Address Campus Issues** 🌟

## 🌐 Live Deployment
**Platform:** TangoH  
**Network:** Arbitrum Stylus  
**Contract Address:** `0xcDFb1272Fad230337C553e8c5649d5C5cf361f03`

## 📖 Overview

TangoH creates a direct, transparent channel for students to report campus issues. 🚀 This platform turns ignored complaints and lost maintenance requests into prioritized, verifiable action items. From broken hostel furniture to safety hazards, TangoH ensures student concerns are heard, validated by the community, and escalated effectively.

**The Problem:** Students face daily frustrations when their concerns go unheard. Reports get lost, emails are ignored, and urgent problems like broken windows or faulty equipment remain unfixed. TangoH makes it hard for students' voices to reach those who can help. 🚧

**The Solution:** TangoH ensures no student's voice is lost. Report issues and let the entire student body vote on them. The problems with the most votes get the most attention, giving campus authorities a clear mandate on what matters most to students. Every report and vote is secured on the blockchain, creating a permanent and transparent record of what students need fixed. ✅

TangoH transforms fragmented complaints into organized, actionable data for campus authorities while empowering students with transparency and collective voice. Build a better campus through collaboration, accountability, and amplified advocacy! 🎉✨
